Choose RESTAPI template || Code 1st approach


nudget package ==> 1) MicrosoftEntityframework core 2) Microsoft entity tools

Create Folder Model ==> Create Entity class and mentioned properties here

Create Folder Data ===> Create Class ApplicationDBContext that extends Dbcontext class from entity framework

In appsettings.json put connection string like this "Server=SERVER_NAME;Database=DATABASE_NAME;Trusted_Connection=True;"

After putting connection string we inject DAL layer class to program.cs & provide connection string using builder object

then inside nudget package console put I) add-migration "initial migration" II) update-migration

migration creates some code that needs to work on DB (basically it generation c# code that runs and builds DB)
